                <p>I moved to the US. The distance between us now became oceans. We still chatted, but the unspoken feelings remained just that‚Äîunspoken. I often wondered what you were thinking, thousands of miles away.</p>

                <p>But once again, distance won the battle. After our engagement, I returned to Santa Barbara while you stayed in India. We were engaged closer then ever before, yet the ocean still separated us. The promise of forever made the distance both sweeter and more painful.</p>
